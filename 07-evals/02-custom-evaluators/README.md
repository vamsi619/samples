# Tutorial 02: Getting Started with Custom Evaluators

## Overview

This tutorial teaches you how to create custom evaluators for domain-specific evaluation criteria. You'll learn to design rubrics, extend the base Evaluator class, and implement multi-metric evaluation workflows tailored to your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- AWS credentials configured (via AWS CLI, environment variables, or IAM role)
- Access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock
- Basic understanding of Python and object-oriented programming
- Completion of Tutorial 01 recommended (but not required)

## What You'll Learn

- How to extend the base `Evaluator` class to create custom evaluators
- Design rubrics with clear scoring criteria (3-point and 5-point scales)
- Create domain-specific evaluators for recipe quality, dietary compliance, and food safety
- Implement an LLM-as-a-judge custom evaluator with a 5-point scale (1-5)
- Combine multiple custom evaluators in a single evaluation workflow
- Understand when to use custom evaluators versus built-in evaluators

## Key Differences from Tutorial 01

| Aspect | Tutorial 01 | Tutorial 02 |
|:-------|:------------|:------------|
| Evaluators | Built-in evaluators (OutputEvaluator, HelpfulnessEvaluator, etc.) | Custom evaluators (domain-specific) |
| Complexity | Uses pre-built evaluation logic | Implements custom evaluation logic |
| Rubrics | Implicit rubrics in built-in evaluators | Explicit rubric design (3-point and 5-point scales) |
| Use Case | General-purpose evaluation | Domain-specific evaluation (recipes) |
| Learning Focus | Understanding available evaluators | Creating new evaluators |

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this tutorial**
   ```bash
   cd tutorials/02-custom-evaluators
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure AWS credentials**

   Ensure your AWS credentials are configured. You can use any of these methods:

   - AWS CLI: `aws configure`
   - Environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION`
   - IAM role (if running on EC2 or ECS)

5. **Verify Bedrock access**

   Ensure you have access to Claude models in Amazon Bedrock:
   ```bash
   aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-east-1
   ```

## Running the Notebook

1. **Start Jupyter**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 02-custom-evaluators.ipynb
   # or
   jupyter lab 02-custom-evaluators.ipynb
   ```

2. **Run all cells**
   - Execute cells sequentially from top to bottom
   - Each cell includes comments explaining its purpose
   - Wait for each evaluation to complete (API calls may take a few seconds)

3. **Expected runtime**
   - Complete notebook execution: 3-5 minutes
   - Most time spent on agent responses and web searches

## Expected Outcomes

After completing this tutorial, you will have:

1. **Four custom evaluators**:
   - `RecipeQualityEvaluator`: Evaluates recipe completeness (ingredients, steps, timing) using a 5-point scale (0-4)
   - `DietaryComplianceEvaluator`: Checks dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten-free, etc.) using a 3-point scale
   - `RecipeSafetyEvaluator`: Validates food safety information using a 3-point scale
   - `RecipeHelpfulnessLLMJudge`: LLM-as-a-judge evaluator for overall helpfulness using a 5-point scale (1-5)

2. **Multi-metric evaluation results**:
   - Each test case evaluated against all four custom evaluators
   - Structured results with scores, labels, and explanations
   - Clear rubric-based assessment
   - LLM-powered nuanced evaluation

3. **Understanding of rubric design**:
   - 3-point scale for simple binary/ternary assessments
   - 5-point scale (0-4) for detailed granular evaluation
   - 5-point scale (1-5) for LLM-as-judge evaluations
   - Clear criteria definitions for each score level

4. **Practical knowledge**:
   - When to create custom evaluators vs use built-in ones
   - Differences between rule-based and LLM-as-judge evaluators
   - How to combine multiple evaluators for comprehensive assessment
   - Best practices for domain-specific evaluation

## Tutorial Structure

The notebook follows this structure:

1. **Environment Setup**: Configure AWS and model settings
2. **Agent Creation**: Recipe Bot agent with web search capabilities
3. **Custom Evaluator Development**:
   - RecipeQualityEvaluator (5-point scale: 0-4)
   - DietaryComplianceEvaluator (3-point scale)
   - RecipeSafetyEvaluator (3-point scale)
   - RecipeHelpfulnessLLMJudge (5-point scale: 1-5, LLM-as-judge)
4. **Test Case Creation**: Three balanced examples covering different scenarios
5. **Multi-Metric Evaluation**: Run all four evaluators on all test cases
6. **Results Analysis**: View formatted results with explanations
7. **LLM-as-Judge Explanation**: Understanding rule-based vs LLM-based evaluation
8. **Best Practices**: Guidance on when to use custom vs built-in evaluators

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'strands'**
   - Solution: Ensure you've installed all dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. **AWS Credentials Error**
   - Solution: Configure AWS credentials using `aws configure` or set environment variables
   - Verify with: `aws sts get-caller-identity`

3. **Bedrock Access Denied**
   - Solution: Ensure your AWS account has access to Bedrock and Claude models
   - Check IAM permissions for `bedrock:InvokeModel`

4. **Rate Limiting from Web Search**
   - Solution: This is expected with DuckDuckGo's free tier. Wait a few seconds and retry
   - The websearch tool includes built-in error handling

5. **Custom Evaluator Returns Unexpected Scores**
   - Solution: Review the rubric criteria in the evaluator code
   - Check that your test case input triggers the expected evaluation logic
   - Custom evaluators use keyword matching; adjust keywords if needed

6. **Jupyter Kernel Issues**
   - Solution: Restart the kernel (Kernel > Restart) and run all cells again
   - Ensure virtual environment is activated before starting Jupyter

### Getting Help

- Review the code comments in the notebook for detailed explanations
- Check Tutorial 01 for foundational concepts
- Consult Strands documentation for API details
- Verify Amazon Bedrock service status if experiencing connectivity issues

## Next Steps

After completing this tutorial, you can:

1. **Experiment with different rubrics**: Modify the scoring scales and criteria
2. **Create your own custom evaluators**: Extend the patterns to your domain
3. **Combine with built-in evaluators**: Use both custom and built-in evaluators together
4. **Proceed to Tutorial 03**: Learn about automated dataset generation
5. **Apply to production**: Use custom evaluators to validate real agent deployments
