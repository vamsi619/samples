- Dataset size

## Key Concepts

### ActorSimulator
AI-powered user personas that engage in realistic multi-turn conversations with your agent. Actors have goals, personalities, and emit stop tokens when satisfied.

### Multi-turn Conversations
Unlike single-turn Q&A, multi-turn evaluation tests conversation flow, context maintenance, and follow-up handling.

### Goal Completion
Actors emit `<stop/>` tokens when their goals are achieved, enabling automated evaluation and efficient testing.

### Persona Diversity
Testing with varied user types (polite, demanding, confused) ensures agent robustness across different communication styles.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AWS Credentials Error
```
Error: Unable to locate credentials
```

**Solution:**
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS credentials when prompted
```

### Issue: Bedrock Access Denied
```
Error: User is not authorized to perform: bedrock:InvokeModel
```

**Solution:**
Ensure your AWS IAM user/role has Bedrock permissions:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": [
    "bedrock:InvokeModel",
    "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

### Issue: Model Not Found
```
Error: Could not resolve model: claude-sonnet-4-0
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify model access in Amazon Bedrock console
2. Check model ID in notebook configuration
3. Update `DEFAULT_MODEL` variable if using different model

### Issue: SQLite Database Locked
```
Error: database is locked
```

**Solution:**
```python
# Close any existing connections
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect("appointments.db")
conn.close()

# Or delete the database file and restart
import os
if os.path.exists("appointments.db"):
    os.remove("appointments.db")
```

### Issue: Conversation Doesn't Complete
```
Actor reaches max_turns without emitting <stop/>
```

**Solution:**
- Check task_description in case metadata is clear
- Increase max_turns parameter
- Simplify the goal to be more achievable
- Review agent responses for completion signals

### Issue: Import Errors
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'strands_evals'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
```

### Issue: Slow Performance
```
Cells take very long to execute
```

**Solution:**
- Reduce max_turns in ActorSimulator
- Decrease dataset size for testing
- Check AWS region latency (use closer region)
- Verify network connection

## Data Files

This tutorial creates the following files:

### appointments.db
SQLite database storing calendar appointments created during evaluation.

**Location**: Same directory as notebook

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE appointments (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    date TEXT,
    location TEXT,
    title TEXT,
    description TEXT
)
```

**Cleanup**: Delete file to reset calendar state
```bash
rm appointments.db
```

## Extending the Tutorial

### Add More Personas
```python
Case(
    name="Impatient User",
    input="Need meeting ASAP!",
    metadata={
        "task_description": "User schedules urgent meeting",
        "traits": ["impatient", "urgent", "brief"]
    }
)
```

### Custom Evaluation Metrics
```python
def calculate_custom_metrics(result):
    return {
        "efficiency_score": result['turns'] / expected_turns,
        "completeness": check_all_details_provided(result),
        "user_satisfaction": analyze_sentiment(result)
    }
```

### Different Agent Types
Replace Personal Assistant with:
- Customer support agent
- Technical troubleshooting agent
- Sales/booking agent
- Educational tutor agent

### Production Integration
```python
# Log conversations to production monitoring
def log_to_monitoring(result):
    metrics = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now(),
        "turns": result['turns'],
        "completed": result['goal_completed'],
        "agent_version": "v1.2.3"
    }
    # Send to your monitoring system
```

### Common Questions

**Q: How many test cases should I create?**
A: Start with 5-10 cases covering critical scenarios. Scale to 20+ for comprehensive evaluation. Production monitoring should track 100+ conversations.

**Q: What's a good success rate?**
A: Aim for 90%+ in development. Production rates of 85-95% are typical depending on use case complexity.

**Q: How do I choose max_turns?**
A: Most conversations complete in 3-5 turns. Set max_turns to 5-7 to allow for complex scenarios while preventing infinite loops.

**Q: Should I test every conversation path?**
A: Focus on critical happy paths, common edge cases, and known failure modes. Use diverse personas to discover unexpected issues.

**Q: How often should I run evaluations?**
A: Run full evaluation suite before each deployment. Use automated CI/CD integration for continuous testing.
