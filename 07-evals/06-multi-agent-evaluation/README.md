# Tutorial 06: Multi-Agent Evaluation

## Overview

This tutorial demonstrates comprehensive evaluation of multi-agent systems where multiple specialized agents collaborate to complete complex tasks. You'll learn to assess individual agent performance, collective system outcomes, and the quality of agent coordination using the InteractionsEvaluator.

## What You'll Learn

- Understand multi-agent architectures (agent-as-tool pattern)
- Evaluate individual agent performance separately
- Assess collective system performance as a whole
- Measure coordination quality using InteractionsEvaluator
- Analyze agent handoffs and collaboration patterns
- Generate comprehensive multi-agent evaluation reports

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Jupyter notebooks
- Understanding of AI agents and multi-agent systems
- Completion of Tutorial 01 (Built-in Evaluators) recommended

### AWS Requirements
- AWS account with Bedrock access
- Claude Sonnet 4.0 model enabled in Amazon Bedrock
- Appropriate IAM permissions for Bedrock API calls
- AWS credentials configured locally

### Python Requirements
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

### Step 1: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Configure AWS Credentials

Ensure your AWS credentials are configured. You can do this by:

**Option 1: AWS CLI Configuration**
```bash
aws configure
```

**Option 2: Environment Variables**
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

**Option 3: AWS Credentials File**
Create or edit `~/.aws/credentials`:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_key
```

## Running the Tutorial

### Option 1: Jupyter Notebook Interface

```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook

# Navigate to and open: 06-multi-agent-evaluation.ipynb
```

### Option 2: JupyterLab Interface

```bash
# Start JupyterLab
jupyter lab

# Navigate to and open: 06-multi-agent-evaluation.ipynb
```

### Option 3: VS Code

```bash
# Open in VS Code
code 06-multi-agent-evaluation.ipynb

# Ensure the Python extension and Jupyter extension are installed
```

## Tutorial Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

1. **Introduction to Multi-Agent Systems**
   - Agent-as-tool pattern explained
   - Multi-agent architecture overview
   - Three evaluation dimensions

2. **Environment Setup**
   - AWS configuration
   - Library imports
   - Tool consent bypass

3. **Multi-Agent System Implementation**
   - Fake database creation
   - Database lookup tools
   - Specialist agent definitions
   - Orchestrator agent creation

4. **Testing the System**
   - Verify orchestrator routing
   - Examine tool call patterns

5. **Dimension 1: Individual Agent Performance**
   - Test each specialist agent separately
   - Evaluate output quality
   - Assess tool selection accuracy

6. **Dimension 2: Collective System Performance**
   - Test complete system with orchestrator
   - Evaluate end-to-end outcomes
   - Measure overall quality

7. **Dimension 3: Coordination Quality**
   - Use InteractionsEvaluator
   - Analyze routing decisions
   - Assess handoff quality

8. **Comprehensive Multi-Agent Report**
   - Combine all three dimensions
   - Generate evaluation summary
   - Coordination metrics analysis

9. **Best Practices**
   - Multi-agent evaluation strategy
   - When to use InteractionsEvaluator
   - Interpreting results

## Expected Runtime

- Full notebook execution: 15-20 minutes
- Individual sections can be run independently
- Evaluation steps may take 2-3 minutes each due to LLM API calls

## Cost Considerations

This tutorial makes multiple calls to Amazon Bedrock:
- Orchestrator calls: ~4 per evaluation
- Specialist agent calls: ~8 per evaluation
- Evaluator calls: ~12 per evaluation

**Estimated cost**: $0.50-$1.00 per complete notebook run (varies by model and region)

## Key Concepts

### Multi-Agent System
A system with multiple specialized AI agents that collaborate under an orchestrator to solve complex problems.

### Agent-as-Tool Pattern
Specialized agents are wrapped as callable tools that can be invoked by an orchestrator agent.

### Three Evaluation Dimensions

1. **Individual Performance**: How well each specialist performs its specific task
2. **Collective Performance**: How well the overall system performs end-to-end
3. **Coordination Quality**: How well agents collaborate and hand off information

### InteractionsEvaluator
A specialized evaluator that assesses multi-agent interactions by analyzing:
- Node names (which agent handled the interaction)
- Dependencies (what information was passed)
- Messages (the output from the agent)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: AWS Credentials Not Found

**Symptoms**:
```
NoCredentialsError: Unable to locate credentials
```

**Solution**:
- Verify AWS credentials are configured using `aws configure`
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Ensure `~/.aws/credentials` file exists and is properly formatted

### Issue: Bedrock Model Access Denied

**Symptoms**:
```
AccessDeniedException: User is not authorized to perform: bedrock:InvokeModel
```

**Solution**:
- Verify your AWS account has Bedrock access enabled
- Check IAM permissions include `bedrock:InvokeModel`
- Ensure Claude Sonnet 4.0 model is enabled in your region

### Issue: Import Errors

**Symptoms**:
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'strands'
```

**Solution**:
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Verify Python version is 3.10 or higher

### Issue: Slow Evaluation Performance

**Symptoms**:
Evaluations take significantly longer than expected

**Solution**:
- This is normal for multi-agent evaluations with many API calls
- Consider reducing test case count for faster iterations
- Check AWS region latency (use region closer to you)
- Verify network connectivity

### Issue: InteractionsEvaluator Returns Empty Results

**Symptoms**:
No interactions captured or empty interaction list

**Solution**:
- Ensure the task function returns a dictionary with 'interactions' key
- Verify `tools_use_extractor.extract_agent_tools_used_from_messages()` is called
- Check that orchestrator.messages contains tool call records
- Confirm agents are actually being invoked (not just responding directly)

### Issue: Orchestrator Not Routing Correctly

**Symptoms**:
Orchestrator answers directly instead of calling specialist agents

**Solution**:
- Review orchestrator prompt to ensure clear routing instructions
- Verify specialist agents are passed as tools to orchestrator
- Check that queries clearly require specialist expertise
- Consider adjusting orchestrator temperature or instructions

## Expected Outputs

After running the complete notebook, you should see:

1. **Individual Agent Reports**: Evaluation results for each of the 4 specialist agents
2. **System-Level Report**: Overall system performance across all test cases
3. **Coordination Report**: InteractionsEvaluator results showing routing and handoff quality
4. **Comprehensive Multi-Agent Report**: Summary combining all three dimensions with:
   - Overall metrics table
   - Individual agent scores
   - System performance assessment
   - Coordination quality analysis
   - Recommendations for improvement
